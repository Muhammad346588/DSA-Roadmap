# 📘 DSA Roadmap

A complete step-by-step roadmap to master **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** using **JavaScript**.  
This repository will help beginners and intermediates learn DSA systematically and prepare for coding interviews. 🚀

## 📅 Roadmap Outline

### 🔹 Week 1–2: Foundations
- Big-O Notation (time & space complexity)
- JavaScript basics for DSA (arrays, objects, loops, functions, ES6 features)
- Array basics: reverse, min/max, linear & binary search

### 🔹 Week 3–4: Arrays & Strings
- Two Pointers & Sliding Window
- Problems: Move Zeros, Rotate Array, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Anagrams, Palindromes

### 🔹 Week 5–6: Hashing & Recursion
- HashMaps / Sets in JS
- Classic problems: Two Sum, Subarray Sum = K, Majority Element
- Recursion & Backtracking basics: Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi, Subsets, Permutations

### 🔹 Week 7–8: Linked List & Stack/Queue
- Singly & Doubly Linked List (implement in JS)
- Problems: Reverse Linked List, Detect Cycle, Merge Two Sorted Lists
- Stack & Queue Problems: Valid Parentheses, Next Greater Element, Queue using Stacks

### 🔹 Week 9–10: Trees & Graphs
- Binary Tree Traversals (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)
- Binary Search Tree (BST) basics
- Problems: Height of Tree, Level Order Traversal, Lowest Common Ancestor
- Graph basics: BFS, DFS, Connected Components, Shortest Path (BFS)

### 🔹 Week 11: Advanced Topics
- Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci DP, Climbing Stairs, Knapsack basics)
- Greedy Algorithms (Activity Selection, Minimum Coins Problem)

### 🔹 Week 12: Mock & Practice
- Daily Mix: 2 Easy + 1 Medium problem
- Contests: LeetCode Weekly, Codeforces Div 3
- Focus on weak areas
